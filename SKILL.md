# HiveMQ Brand Guidelines Application

This skill helps apply HiveMQ's brand guidelines to documents, presentations, and other materials to ensure consistent brand representation.

## Brand Overview

HiveMQ's brand identity centers on:
- The iconic **bee logo** (the HiveMQ logomark)
- Vibrant **yellow and black color scheme**
- **Modern, sleek design** ethos
- **Clarity and simplicity** (focus away from unique service/product logos toward unified HiveMQ brand)

## Primary Logo

The HiveMQ logo is the face of the brand. HiveMQ has shifted toward using a unified logo rather than unique logos for individual services and products.

**Logo Files:**
- Primary horizontal logo (color and negative versions)
- Vertical logo (color and negative versions)
- Logomark (bee icon) - can be used alone when HiveMQ context is already established

## Logomark Usage

The iconic bee logo can be used in isolation, but ONLY when:
- The full HiveMQ logo has already been shown in the document/presentation
- The audience clearly understands the reference to HiveMQ
- Context makes it obvious this represents HiveMQ

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

**Yellow (HiveMQ Gold)**
- Hex: `#FFC000`
- RGB: 255, 192, 0
- CMYK: 0, 25, 100, 0
- Use: Primary brand color, backgrounds, accents, highlights

**Black**
- Hex: `#000000`
- RGB: 0, 0, 0
- CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 100
- Use: Text, backgrounds, contrast elements

**White**
- Hex: `#FFFFFF`
- RGB: 255, 255, 255
- CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0
- Use: Text on dark backgrounds, negative space, clean layouts

### Secondary Colors

**Teal (Accent Color)**
- Hex: `#037DA5`
- RGB: 3, 125, 165
- CMYK: 98, 24, 0, 35
- Use: Small, purposeful applications only - not a primary brand color
- Examples: Subtle accents, secondary UI elements, data visualization variety

### Color Usage Guidelines

1. **Primary palette**: Yellow, white, and black should dominate all brand materials
2. **Teal sparingly**: Use teal only in small doses for specific purposes
3. **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (black text on white, white text on black or yellow)
4. **Backgrounds**: Prefer white or black backgrounds with yellow accents
5. **Never dilute**: Don't use washed-out or pale versions of brand colors

## Typography

### Slide Best Practices

1. **Minimal text**: 5-7 lines maximum per slide, 5-7 words per line
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and color to guide the eye
3. **White space**: Don't fill every inch - let content breathe
4. **Consistency**: Use same layout patterns throughout
5. **Image quality**: Use high-resolution images (150+ DPI)
6. **Readability**: Text should be readable from 10-15 feet away

## Usage of Logos and Trademarks

### Logo Placement
- Always allow clear space around the logo (minimum = height of the bee)
- Don't stretch, skew, or distort the logo
- Don't place logo on busy backgrounds where it loses clarity
- Don't use logomark alone unless HiveMQ context is established

### Logo File Selection
- **Full logo (horizontal)**: Primary use, headers, documents
- **Full logo (vertical)**: Tight spaces, mobile, square formats
- **Logomark (bee)**: Established context, small applications, watermarks
- **Color version**: White or light backgrounds
- **Negative version**: Black or dark backgrounds

### Prohibited Uses
- Don't alter logo colors (except approved negative/white version)
- Don't add effects (shadows, glows, bevels, gradients)
- Don't rotate the logo
- Don't place logo elements separately
- Don't create custom versions or variations

### Trademark Notice

## Notes for Claude

When applying these guidelines:

1. **DOCX files**: Always set page size explicitly to US Letter, use Arial font, implement the color scheme in table headers and accents
2. **PPTX files**: Create a consistent master template with logomark in corner, use appropriate color scheme for backgrounds
3. **Multiple color schemes**: Offer variety (white bg, black bg, yellow accent slides) while maintaining brand consistency
4. **Logo usage**: Include the logo appropriately but don't overuse - once per document type is often sufficient
5. **Color restraint**: Yellow and black are primary; use teal very sparingly
6. **Professional quality**: These are enterprise materials for a B2B tech company - maintain high standards
7. **When in doubt**: Lean toward simplicity, clarity, and the primary yellow/black/white palette

Remember: The bee logo and yellow/black color scheme are the most recognizable elements of HiveMQ's brand. Use them consistently and prominently.
